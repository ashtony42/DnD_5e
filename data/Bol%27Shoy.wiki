++ Bol'Shoy

A festival where all colleges of the land come to compete, and ultimately entertain the masses, takes places at towns that have bard colleges.

At the peak of a successful Bol'Shoy festival, a Ki-Rin (pg 163 of Volos) will be summoned from another plane, and it will fly overhead, sprinkling down a glitter of gold for all to behold. A truely awesome sight.

For those with Evil alignments, they'll be a bit repulsed by the specticle.
