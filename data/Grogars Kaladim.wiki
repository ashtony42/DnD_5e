++ Grogars Kaladim

 [Gruumsh] has opened up a portal in the depths where some orcs has passed through into the material realm, and have constructed a crude defensive chamber against the [Mistwraith] purple worm until thier commander, [Grogar] sets them free. (100 ft down)
      - the portal leads to a cube in the plane [Acheron] that contains a large segment of Gruumsh's followers
      - the portal which is a large Granite cube that has a red glow coming from beyond a rocky tunnel in it
      - Orcs that came through the portal at first were orcs that got consumed by the [Mistwraith] Wurm, then later used as a dumping zone for prisoners of war from the realm of [Acheron]
      - follower of [Kadi], [Kethra] 
      
++++POST MISTWRAITH REMOVAL
      The orcish forges, taskmaster Klahsh, strict, allows no slacking!
        the orcs of [Acheron] have repurposed the forges to smelt unusable metal  weapons and armour into.... "usable" weapons and armour
        
      The portal ramparts
        should the orc lose the cube position in [Acheron] that was incredible undefendable, they have a wonderful funnel that is, this portal.
        -The top is lined with braiziers that keep tar boiling at all times. (found conventiently all around the outside area!)
        -10 orcs with crude crossbows line the top ledge as well.
        -the immediate area around the portal has blackened wood spike pallisade with roughly 20 orc spearmen who keep guard.
        
      The Eye's Room
        [Lok'Nar]'s room, where order to this stronghold is made while King [Grogar] is away.
        
      Boar Pens
        The primary source of food for the orcs, fed a diet of the parts of thier fallen enemies in [Acheron] 
        -3g per boar       
        -5s per piglet
        
      Water Well
        The previous place where the [Daughter of the Night] was kept by [Venril Sathir], when dug just 50ft deeper by the orcs, water was struck and is now an important source of water.
        
      Torture room:
        Torture is a form of entertainment for bored orcs!
        2 soldiers of [Kadi] and an ogre are in here.
        -one being roticeried over a fire (cooked for the boars if she doesn't speak, win-win!)
        -digits being cut off of the other Kadi soldier ([Kethra]) 
        -the ogre is tied down to the floor, with a boulder being gradually lowered on his torso by ropes. Being crushed into an ogre donut.
        
      Orc Forges:
        Lit and running by the order [Grogar] sent to [Lok'Nar]
        A large crate of weapons and armor are inside
        -shields, swords, whips
        
      Mines:
        Iron Copper and Gold are being mined, as well as a small number of gems  
        Tunnels inevitably begin to connect with the Worm Mistwraith tunnels, and are used to go up/down to the Red Cube portal area.
        
      Southern Docks:
        The orcs have been ordered to attack [Marine HQ], then [Ak'anon](who supposedly follow [Kadi]) via order of king [Grogar]
        Wood is sparse and it will take much time for them to build a fleet (4 ships)
