++ Session 3 Notes

The party of [Kyra Usagi], [Kieran Maon] and [Jack the Slumberjack] chose to sail west after a heist they pulled, stealing [Mayor Ubring]'s locked metal safe.

At sea, they managed to figure out the first two numbers of the safe's combination, 

The party sailed west to [Fiore] following the map they found on [Redbeard The Unlucky]'s ship. 

Along the way, they encountered one of the raided islands that Redbead had visited, a burnt structure and a corpse picked clean by crabs was found. Upon further exploring the island, the found one of the elven ruins that contained the right arm of [Tharizdun].

To further make sure they didn't get caught be authorities, they parked their boat on a small island north of [Mayara] and rowed to the dock. 

They encountered [Harris Flennre] who was actively trying to sell Wolfsbane to people who would be traveling through the woods to Mayara. The party instead opted to be escorted by him but play a trick to try to prove his product defective. In the end, Harris payed each of the adventurers a gold due to tricking him.
