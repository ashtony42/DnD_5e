This island sits on the edge of the dark waters of [Kunark] similarly to [Dun Morhen]

The weather tends to be stormy and foggy. The ground has sparce foliage due to the contamination of the dark waters, but is in considerably better shape than the mainland of Kunark. The island has trees with fewer branches than one would expect, but they manage to grow alright.

There was once a refugee camp here, slaves that used to work the farmland of [Luthadel] owned by [House Zolis]. A pile of their rotting bodies can be found in the center of the camp.

This escape was made possible by the efforts of the [Renegade Leader Kelsier] who through his criminal connections was able to recruit the mercenary band [Golden Hand] to aid with this exodus on a stolen sailing ship. Many lives were lost in the process, many loved ones too, but it was what had to be done for their freedom.
