++ Obox-ob

Obox-ob is depicted as a giant, platter-shaped centipede, with three scorpion-like tails each tipped with a humanoid head with a purple razor-edged tongue. 

It commands the 663rd layer of the [Abyss], a vermin-infested wasteland known as [Zionyn]. Unlike many of the infamous demon princes in the setting, Obox-ob is an obyrith.
