++ Libelle

Love interest of [Alas], 

used to be found in the [Feywild] with the appearance of an elf in [Tajuru]
but since [Alas] left thousands of years ago, she became bitter, lonely, and took residence in the wyvern cave of [Ko Foren]

Will be elderly and bitter that [Alas] LEFT her during the war when found (4100 years old in dragon years)


[Alas] weenie:
"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST 4 THOUSAND YEARS?"
"YOU LEFT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR"
"YOU DIDN'T EVEN SAY WHERE YOU WERE GOING"
"I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD"
