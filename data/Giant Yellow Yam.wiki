++ Giant Yellow Yam

(to the tune of Yellow Submarine by the beatles)

In the land where I was grown
Grew a yam who fell to the sea
And he rolled with its new life
to the land of yellow yams 

So we sailed up to the sun
till we found a sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our giant yellow yam

CHORUS:
We all live in a giant yellow yam
giant yellow yam, giant yellow yam
We all live in a giant yellow yam
giant yellow yam, giant yellow yam

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them grow next door
And the band begins to play

CHORUS

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our giant yellow yam

CHORUS
