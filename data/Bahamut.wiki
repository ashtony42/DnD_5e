a massive, long and sinuous dragon with silver-white scales and blue, catlike eyes.

About a quarter of the time, Bahamut wanders in the shape of a human or some other guise. He is said to have been encountered as a frail old hermit, with the seven great golden wyrms that accompany him disguised as seven canaries singing sweetly nearby.


When Released:
    -by an evil diety being present in the world:
        -will peacefully leave his lair as a frail old hermit and begin doing what is needed to stop the evil.
    -by an attack that deals more than 250 damage:
        -will awaken and retaliate before going back to sleep.
