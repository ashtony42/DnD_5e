++ Execution of Quaal

A large gathering of grungy skaa are gathered at the city square where a large wooden platform has been erected for the occasion. The platform has dark stains that seem to run down the sides of it, leading up to a central chopping block, for executions.

Speech by a brother of the [Order of Steel]
"Here we have a skaa who dares mess with the order of our land. Bending the very fabric of our world. For what? For his own profits and pride. If we let this man run loose, who knows how much more harm would be done by his ambition. Let this be an example that the God King, Venril Sathir, our lord, is the only one capable of handling such forces."
