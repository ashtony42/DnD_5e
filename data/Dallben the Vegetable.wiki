++ Dallben the Vegetable

Human, old
Taken care of by his old apprentice, [Tara]

Dallben the Vegetable was once a reputable wizard in the underground society of [Luthadel], mastering the ways of stealth and evasion. Many years ago when [Steel Inquisitor]s attempted to hunt him down and were grossly unsuccessful, they put malicious magical "recipies" into circulation in various underground markets, where he was known to shop occasionally. He attempted to craft the malicious "Sending Stones" recipie unknownly, failed, and his voice and personality were trapped inside the stone.

His apprentice, [Tara], to make ends meet, has been slowly selling off his items, including what is known as the [Sentient Rock Henry] which contains Dallben's voice and personality, and the recipie, which to [Tara] still looks legit, but caused this horrible accident.

When spoken to, Dallben will look at people, and move his mouth at people, seeing his thoughts will yield very mechanical and brief answers to questions
