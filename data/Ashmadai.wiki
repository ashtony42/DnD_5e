++ Ashmadai

A hidden cult devoted to [Asmodeus]

lead by the dwarven priest [Favria]

the cult has about a meager 10 members, and have not had any successful contact with [Asmodeus] although not due to a lack of trying. [Cael Caemond] was given access to the cult recently when he brought them the head of [Tharizdun] which has been making their rituals more productive.

The cult seeks to bring demons into the world to cleanse the weak.

Notable members:
[Cael Caemond] - former mercencary for the [Golden Hand] and previous member of the [Bandits of Deception]

Members have a minor boon:

++++Sense Devils: 
    (Can sense the presence of devils within 500ft, though not the location)
    Advantage on Perception rolls for Devils
