++ Materials of Legendary Craftsmen

-[Stone of Kord] A perfectly spherical stone with a transluscent glean like that of polished granite. Said to be unbreakable, but is lost to the sands of [Taipan] for as long as time can tell.

-Flail Snail Shell (pg 144 of volos) - Weights about 250 pounds and has numerous uses. Smiths have been able to make up to three shields from one shell, which grant anti magical properties. Tailors have been able to grind it down into dust used to imbue lavish garments. Some simply sell them to nobles to love the luster of the colorful shell for thousands of gold. Very dangerous to acquire though, as they live thier days in the safety of Dragon Turtle lairs away from predatory Kraken that would feast upon them. 

-Great Treant of [Tajuru] - Every few hundred years, a treant grows so old and large enough to gain the respect of it's fellow tree fey, and they will gather around it to protect it's wisdom and history, to those who have harvested this great treant's lumber though have been greatly rewarded with the strongest, most beautiful lumber they've ever acquired, with such life force that it's said to continue to grow even after being harvested.
