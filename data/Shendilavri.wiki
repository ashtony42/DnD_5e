Demon Lord: [Malcanthet], Queen of the succubi

Before [Malcanthet]'s domain it was a vast plane of living flesh, but Malcanthet turned it into a beautiful world of grassy hills on the shore of an ocean under perpetual sunset.

Among the carefully built white buildings throughout the hills, Malcanthet's seat of power was in the coastal city of [Rivenheart], said to contain all possible pleasures and desires to tempt its visitors into relaxing. It was also home to the [Radiant Sisters], Malcanthet's own personal guards and loyal lilitu bards who protected her from would-be usurpers.
