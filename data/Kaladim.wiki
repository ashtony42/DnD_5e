++ Kaladim

An ancient dwarven city built into a mountain. A large statue of a dwarf (50ft tall) standing proud with his respectively large battle axe overgrown with vines stands vigil at the top of the entrance. 

Clearing the vines reveals the entrance below the statue.

The inside is littered with broken human arms, the remainder of each respective body is nowhere to be found. Many bricks and other masonry lie about the caves as if they were once part of some previously existing structure.

++++Grogar's Kaladim
    [Gruumsh] has opened up a portal in the depths where some orcs has passed through into the material realm, and have constructed a crude defensive chamber against the [Mistwraith] purple worm until thier commander, [Grogar] sets them free. 
      - the portal leads to a cube in the plane [Acheron] that contains a large segment of Gruumsh's followers
      - the portal which is a large Granite cube that has a red glow coming from beyond a rocky tunnel in it
      - Orcs that came through the portal at first were orcs that got consumed by the [Mistwraith] Wurm, then later used as a dumping zone for prisoners of war from the realm of [Acheron]
