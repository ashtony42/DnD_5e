++ Kaladim

An ancient dwarven city built into a mountain. A large statue of a dwarf (50ft tall) standing proud with his respectively large battle axe overgrown with vines stands vigil at the top of the entrance. 

Clearing the vines reveals the entrance below the statue.

The inside is littered with broken human arms, the remainder of each respective body is nowhere to be found. Many bricks and other masonry lie about the caves as if they were once part of some previously existing structure.

++++The Dry Well
  Of all the rocky caves, this is the place that most resembles it's original construction, ancient dwarven stonework around what would have been a very deep pool of well water.

++++Grogar's Kaladim
    [Gruumsh] has opened up a portal in the depths where some orcs has passed through into the material realm, and have constructed a crude defensive chamber against the [Mistwraith] purple worm until thier commander, [Grogar] sets them free. (100 ft down)
      - the portal leads to a cube in the plane [Acheron] that contains a large segment of Gruumsh's followers
      - the portal which is a large Granite cube that has a red glow coming from beyond a rocky tunnel in it
      - Orcs that came through the portal at first were orcs that got consumed by the [Mistwraith] Wurm, then later used as a dumping zone for prisoners of war from the realm of [Acheron]
      - follower of [Kadi], [Kethra] 
      
    POST MISTWRAITH REMOVAL
      The orcish forges, taskmaster Klahsh, strict, allows no slacking!
        the orcs of [Acheron] have repurposed the forges to smelt unusable metal  weapons and armour into.... "usable" weapons and armour
        
      The portal ramparts
        should the orc lose the cube position in [Acheron] that was incredible undefendable, they have a wonderful funnel that is, this portal.
        -The top is lined with braiziers that keep tar boiling at all times. (found conventiently all around the outside area!)
        -10 orcs with crude crossbows line the top ledge as well.
