Weeny: Glider Races!
    -A group of 12 Kors gliding at tremendous speeds whiz by, all wearing goggles and tight fit clothes. Off in the distance where they are headed are two large crowds on either side of a large red banner that spans between two plateus.
    -These happen every day, 10g to enter, 120g awarded to the winner! 
        (1d20 + Flight Speed/10 + DEX-mod) against DC 25
    -Ace Ghorlan is the best known glider who is known to win a majority of the races, and makes his living off of it. (All-Might type of personality, wide smile)
