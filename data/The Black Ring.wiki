++ The Black Ring

A black steel ring with a white inlay design

this ring is fairly interesting. When worn, the ring shrinks to be almost flush with the skin of its wearer. The wearer of this ring is able to turn invisible as a bonus action while in darkness or dim light. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.

Cursed. This ring is cursed and cannot be removed from the finger except by a remove curse spell or similar magic. The skin on the finger and hand of the wearer start to turn black, with the darkness spreading from the ring up onto the arm over the course of (1d6+1d8) days. After this amount of time, the skin starts to rot as if from necrosis. The wearer's maximum hit points are reduced by 1d4 each week (or day, it's up to the DM). This reduction to your maximum hit points cannot be restored except through magical means. Once your maximum hit points are reduced by one-fifth, you gain disadvantage on any ability check using the effected arm. Once your maximum hit points are reduced by two-fifths, your arm falls off. If your arm falls off, the attunement to the ring ends, thus preventing further necrosis from this object.
