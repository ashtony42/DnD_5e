++ Ring of Drowning

This wooden ring has a small teardrop-shaped gem embedded in it. If you put the ring on while underwater, you gain the ability to breathe underwater.

Curse. When you put this ring on while not underwater, your lungs start filling with water. If you need to breathe and can't breathe water, you run out of breath; after a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), you drop to 0 hit points and are dying, and can't regain hit points or become stabilized until the ring is removed. A creature must use their action and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Arcana) ability in order to remove the ring from you while you are drowning this way.
