++ Kaleb the Galeb

Children, where Gorro who just got his magical aptitude is thrilled with his new Galeb creation, celebrating it around town.

+++By Korred Children:
Caleb the Galeb
is a jolly happy soul
with a stalagmite pipe
and a crystal nose
and two eyes made out of coal

Caleb the Galeb
Was just a lump of stone they say
with a little soul
you now all know
how he came to life today

there must have been some magic in
my semantics I just used
for when I placed my hand on his head
he began to dance around

OOOOH

Caleb the Galeb
Is alive as he can be
and my friends say
he can laugh and play
just the same as you an me 

+++By Caleb:
Caleb the Galeb
you just learned magic today
so I say lets run 
and we'll have some fun
before the magic fades away

Down to the village
with a wood staff in my hand
we'll run here and there
all around the square saying
"catch me if you can!"

+++By narrator
they went down the streets of town 
right to the sages shop.
they paused for a moment when
Helja hollered "STOP!"

+++By Caleb:
Caleb the Galeb
I have to hurry on my way
Say goodbye
and don't you cry
as you'll learn to summon me again some day

(commence lecture from sage Helja about the dangers of summoning Galeb Dhur on a whim as he dispells Caleb)
