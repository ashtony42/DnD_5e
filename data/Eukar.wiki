++ Eukar

(Neriak), home of the Vegepygmies, small plant people, within the [Feywild] 

Eukar has a lot of short vegetation and very sunny skies with lots of rain (yes, rain with no clouds, whuuuut)
There is no central city, but its as if the forest island itself IS the city, and the places of interest are just greatly spread accross the land.

Vegepygmy - (pg 196)
have no leader, and work in harmony together
