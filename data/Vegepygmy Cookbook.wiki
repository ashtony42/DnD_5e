++ Vegepygmy Cookbook

Vegepygmys are our friends, and a professional chef should know how to cater to these customers. 

Do not cook with meat, as this is often poisonous to them.
Do not cook with plants, as this is akin to cannibalism to them, the worst thing you could possibly make.

Instead, we have a well thought out list of dishes that will make any Vegepygmy friend happy!
    -Fermented Compost Pudding
        -Add rock sugar and dirt to a barrel, let sit for at least 2 weeks, serve
    -Glowing Oil Dressing
        -Glow Vine Extract
    -Grilled Mush Cap Steak
        -Over an open fire, grill a mushroom cap, rare, so that there is still a little blue inside, cooking until it is completely red is considered weak.
