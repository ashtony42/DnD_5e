Oscar's wife is Shirley Lofeudo 

He's enjoyed the deathly quiet life of the wilderness, but has recently been having to go to [Evernight]'s corpse market to pick up some extra heads because he keeps losing them to pesky Vargouilles (pg 195 of volos) that moved into a nearby cave!

Reward: Magic items 
  Eyes of the Eagle that he acquired to get around without a head
