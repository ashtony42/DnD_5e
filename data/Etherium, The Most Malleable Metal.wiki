++ Etherium, The Most Malleable Metal

Etherium might possibly the most wonderous of all the metals in this world. Most metals conduct heat and thus are made malleable to work with, etherium seems to constantly be in this soft state, making it the easiest to form. However, that is not what is most impressive about this material. It's properties allow it to conduct magic! In my times as an enchanting smith, I had wished I had come accross this material earlier in my career, back when it would have been more useful. The enchantments that I place upon it become stronger and hold better, and the green luster of the metal begins to glow when I do so. 

Etherium on it's own isn't strong enough to make anything practical, but when I inlay the metal onto another item, it continues to help tremendously with making the item conduct my magic. I can only imagine what things would have happened if heroes of the past like [Regdar] or [Dack Greyhall] knew of this. I wonder if they even had Etherium available in thier time.

Unfortunately, this has not helped me work with Dimeritium, even when I work an inlay into an item made of this metal. My enchantments still do not hold. Dimeritium has the poorest magical conductivity of any metal I've ever worked with.
