+++FEYWILD MEMORIES
Briar had a dugout home in the humble firbolg town of [Otis]

Good friends with the vegepymies of [Eukar]
 - was able to have the druids of Eukar open a portal that lead to the other world that was causing illness in theirs
 - if revisited [Briar] will find that they can no longer perform the ritual because they are missing members of the Mahoganny family
