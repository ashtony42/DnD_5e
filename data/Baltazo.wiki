Baltazo appears as an extremely corpulent human man with an elongated face and deep green skin that constantly fizzles and pops, spilling a variety of sickly fluids upon a poor-fitting military uniform festooned with dozens of ostentatious medals and ribbons.

Although not powerful enough to have stake in the [Hollows Heart], he resides above in the iron fortress of [Shullen-Gat] where he can influence the realm from afar.

Dreams one day to have a firm hold within the [Hollows Heart].
