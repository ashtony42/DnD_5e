++ Tharizdun Cultist Camp


EVIL GROUP (or if [Vecna] is slain)

on the outskirts of [Nicosia], souls released from the torrent of souls at the [Rotting Tower] found bodies to inhabit amungst the countless zombies that wander around [Nicosia].

these 97 individuals strong minded enough to ignore the effects of the [Exanimate Stone] set up camp in a nearby area that has a few trees.

The camp is centered around the largest tree in the visible area. Patterns are made in a circle around it using depressions in the ground filled with blood and stones placed in specific ways. The trunk of the tree has many stems (23) that might have once had a leaf or flower growing directly from the trunk of this dying tree. 

The cultists are still determining who amungst them will take lead now that they are free from the torrent of souls
Ezeem (human body) - believes [Tharizdun] will appear himself to select one of them
Kanishk (elf body) (lightning [AkumaFruits]) - believes [Tharizdun] has granted him the greatest boon in order to lead the cult
Madrugad (goliath body) (black dragon adult [AkumaFruits])- believes that in being the oldest worshiper, he has earned the position
Elagabalus (half orc body) - believes the cult should be lead by council

Awoken powers present at the camp:
  Lightning
  Displacer Beast
  Black Dragon (Adult)
  Projectile Limbs (ranged unarmed attacks) limb dies, body part regrows nearly immediately
  Mango (grows mangos from arms)
  Extra Blood (constantly bleeding from the wounds present on the host body)
