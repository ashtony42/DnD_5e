++ The Endless Woods

A book is a published journal of the Furbolg, Gritters.

Gritters had sought out more of the world, and traveled to [Eukar] and got to witness a joyful festival of dance and song around The Great Oak like none of the other bard colleges have ever performed. He was invited to go inside a hole that opened in the Great Oak that lead to the homeland of the Vegepymies at the peak of the festival. A beautiful forest untouched by animal kind. Walking under a canopies that spanned for miles, and plants and flowers that he had never seen before. 

Being true to his druidic nature, he left the realm without picking any of the flora. Understandably, no one he told his story to would believe him, but he would prefer it that way than to have tainted that perfect home of the Vegepymies.
