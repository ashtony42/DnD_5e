++ Lothric

an emaciated necromancer that has no use of his limbs. Was once an experiment of [Velsharoon], and then a personal assistant, but once Lothric gained enough knowledge of necromancy from [Velsharoon], he banished [Velsharoon] to the material realm and assumed rule of [Nicosia]. Occasionally Lothric "hides" to cull some of his population. Hiding entains simply suppressing the [Exanimate Stone] which then allows the hoard of lesser intellect undead to roam and attack at random. 

his withered scalp has 32 eyes all over it, allowing him to see in all directions, keeping him very alert.

A stone embedded in his ribcage is the [Exanimate Stone], a corpse that maintains contact with the stone is granted the intellect it had in life. 

Lothric maintains a Telepathic Bond with his brother [Lorian], and due to his lower intellect, simply instructs him how to move.


Use Necromancer (pg 217) HP 100, AC 23 (Lothric favors himself over his brother [Lorian], and will use him as a meat shield.)
