++ Coloca Farming Techniques

As you may have observed over time, Coloca trees do not have seeds. So one might ask, how do you grow them?

A Coloca leaf that isn't immediately consumed can be laid on the ground when it has used all of it's energy flying. Then, around the edge of the leaf, there will be sprouts that form. Take care, as at this point there will be more sprouts than what the area of soil will allow, prune as necessary until there is one sprout. Water regularly if weather is not favorable and keep away from creatures that would eat the young sprout. Within a few years, you'll have a Coloca tree that can serve all of your transportation needs!
