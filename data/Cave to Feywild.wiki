  A room covered in more bioluminescent vines with a few small animal bones that can be found around the edges.

++++F. Aboleth Pool

  Galeb Duhr (pg 139) might attack from behind the party
  
++++H. The Portal
    walking through the portal you see a bright pale green light fill your vision that feels comfortably warm, reducing visibility to 5ft, as you walk further the ground feels to have a steeper, and steeper incline, eventually until it becomes too dificult to maintain footing (check if they want to continue). They slide, down the slope, which then changes into a fall. (Falling 50 feet) then vision is restored as they collide with a stone cave floor.  
    
++++I. The Landing
    Glowing cave crickets jump away and hide under yet more glowing vines that densly fill the room.
    A stone wall(door) has Sylvan written on it in a playful tone reads:
      "If you are reading this, hello! Could you please turn back if you're up to no good? We'd really appretiate it. Thank you so much!"
    
    Demolishing the door will reveal a mound of dirt and a really old tree that has piled up/grown around the other side. But there will be an opening large enough for the party to pass through.
