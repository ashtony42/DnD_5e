The God King of [Luthadel]
A very oppressive king who has undergone dragon mutations as well as having consumed the Etherium element akuma fruit.
His very existence is for perpetuating the seal he has on the god [Gruumsh] through a synergystic process of using his own
etherium existence to both extend his own life as well as power the seal.
