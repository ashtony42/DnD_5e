++ Abraxas

Abraxas, known as the Unfathomable, is the demon lord of magic words, arcane secrets, and talismans. Abraxas dwells on the 17th layer of the Abyss, known as Death's Reward. His portfolio is given as forbidden lore, magic, and snakes. As in Armies of the Abyss, Abraxas's realm is called the [Pleroma] here, and it is said to be a superficially pleasant and beautiful realm whose true appearance is masked by illusions. Abraxas rules from the spiral city of [Diovengia], which is filled with demons, libraries, and serpents and guarded by mariliths. Instead of the chaste ascetics of Armies of the Abyss, however, his cultists in this book are drow and keepers of forbidden lore who maintain a notorious library and tattoo their greatest secrets on their bodies
