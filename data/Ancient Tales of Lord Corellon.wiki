++ Ancient Tales of Lord Corellon

The legendary Lord Corellon was a mighty man who mysteriously dissapeared millions of years ago. They say all of the major cities of the world were founded by him, supported by him, and prospered by his efforts. He was also responsible for banishing the Orruk from ever returning, and true enough, one has never been seen.
