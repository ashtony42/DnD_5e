  [Asha], a Marilith, has been hunting in Spirac for a long time trying to find game that she can offer that [Soneillon]'s lake for immortality. Of the demon beasts she has offered, none have been accepted. Including a Yeth Hound, Vorr, Nightmare Beast.
    

The Youthful Crone lives in a lake at the center of the infinite layer of Spirac: mortals desiring immortality in the form of eternal youth travel to the Hunting Ground of the [Abyss] in order to offer their souls to [Soneillon] as payment for this

This layer was a perpetual wilderness that resisted any attempt at civilization. Its dense fern forests and weeds quickly consumed any buildings until not even their ruins remained. For that reason, the layer had no ruler and served as hunting grounds for demon lords seeking game such as yeth hounds, vorrs, and nightmare beasts.

Atop one of the central mountains of the layer, there was a pool that had the power to rejuvenate a mortal that bathed in it. The price was to surrender a part of one's free will to [Soneillon] as well as an offering that is greater than the offerings before it, a demon lady who dwelt in the depths of the pool
