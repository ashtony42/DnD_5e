++ Prime Realm

Home of The Prime [Gods]
[Loam] - Matter
[Ka] - Energy
[Ur] - Time

  At the center of all realms, is the Prime Realm, A deep nestled layer that is the center, and exterior of everything, simultaneously.
  Being in this realm requires a traveler to have attuned to all other realms.
  
  People in the Prime Realm always feel as if they're in the center of an enourmous orb, and no matter how far or fast they travel, never can get any closer to it.
  
  [Loam] One Third of the orb appears as a solid brown slab.
  [Ka] One Third of the orb appears as a rainbow of gasses fading in and out like a kaleidascope.
  [Ur] One Third of the orb appears as river that flows in and out of itself like a knot with no beginning or end
