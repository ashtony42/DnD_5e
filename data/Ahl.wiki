++ Ahl

Ahl is a god who might arguably have the strongest will of all the gods.
Ahl however, is just a stone, no bigger than a chicken egg.
Ahl cannot speak to anyone but it's creator [Rhin]

Home Realm [Gehenna]
Where Ahl feels most alive, tumbling forever down it's infinite hill

Ahl was acquired from [Rhin] when [Venril Sathir] murdered her. He needed Ahl to turn [Kadi]'s armour against her, turning her into a black steel statue.
