++ Shadowsea

Demon Lord: [Dagon], Prince of the Darkened Depths

This layer was a deep and perpetually dark ocean. It was the realm of the obyrith Dagon, who ruled it from inside an amorphous slimy palace inhabited by giant sea worms and luminescent gliding creatures. The realm was connected to the deepest trenches of [Gaping Maw].

The layer was inhabited mostly by wastriliths, who had free reign of the depths, as well as roaming gigantic half-alive shapeless clouds of discolored pollution that stripped the flesh from anything that entered them.
