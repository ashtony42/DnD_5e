Land of the endless forest

Every plant in every realm is said to be able to grow here, regardless of the nutrient and temperate needs of the plant, the land provides.

This realm is lead by the god [Silvanus]

Vegepymies (from volos) are the main inhabitants of this realm.
They do not organize into cities, but often wander and enjoy the realm for the grand forest that it is.
