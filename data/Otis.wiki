++ Otis

(Augsburg), a lush farming town of Firbolg who both farm crops and raise animals

They write exclusively in Druidic. For those who can't see/read druidic, it may appear like they are acquiring amusement from blank books, navigating with blank signs, shopping from blank menus

Has no leader, everyone works together in harmony with nature.
