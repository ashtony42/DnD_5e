++ Buntri

The Deep Gnomes of Buntri live primarily in seclusion, though the majority of the world know where they live, and know that seclusion is how they prefer thier lives.

The entrance of Buntri is an enourmous bronze gear that has been weathered by the elements. It does seem to have moved enough though to prevent plants from growing upon it.
