++ Kethra

A follower of [Kadi] who was captured by forces of [Gruumsh] in [Acheron], and upon interrogation and not divulging any information, she was thrown into the recently opened portal that had a "horrible beast" inside. (the portal to [Kaladim]) She is found at the bottom of the mining area of [Kaladim] amungst the remains of the first orcs who explored in here, and found the terrible beast inside, as well as some of her fellow followers who were interrogated before her.

She has knowledge of which cubes to jump to get to [Kadi]'s stronghold in [Acheron]
(three jumps for the shortest route, by gaining the aggression of followers of [Gruumsh] on the second jump to tempt [Gruumsh] into altering the course of the third)

(six jumps for the longer, safer route, accross some cubes that were home to recent battles (covered with dead members of [Gruumsh] [Vaprak] and [Kadi])

with Gruumsh back in [Acheron], the cubes are a little more predictble that "pure chaos"

EVIL GROUP NOTE:
Told by [Vulcan] to go back to [Acheron] and kill orcs, and she will do so since she has been charmed to join the evil group for the next year.
