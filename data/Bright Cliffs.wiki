Long Fishers
    Fishermen who use cartoonishly huge fishing rods (about 12 feet long) with a spool of fishing line that's about the size of a coffee tin. This is so that they can fish from the comfortable cliff top. The fish they catch don't tend to be too large due to how far they have to reel them up.
    -Long Fishers tend to have very muscled arms due to the stress of holding a fish on a line as they also reel it up the cliff.
