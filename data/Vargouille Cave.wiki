++ Vargouille Cave

Vargouille pg 195 of Volos

one of the heads (previously [Oscar the Headless]'s) has a set of 2 Ebony Fly earings (pg 169)

50 Vargouilles have taken up residence in this man made cave. Unfortunate travelers of the past must have used it long ago for shelter. There seems to be no sign of activity here.

Inside there is a wide tree log surrounded by 3 smaller logs, arranged like a table and chairs, one portion of the table shows signs of fire damage.

The inside the cave is more natural as it goes farther in [Xolkin], a Wight (pg 300) lays resting (with a thick layer of dust on him) looking dead on top of a bedroll.

10 Darkmantles (pg 46) are then in a very natural looking part
