++ Nicosia

the [Shadowfell] reflection of [Mayara] in [Fiore]

formerly ruled by the lich [Velsharoon], this city has become a undead slum for undead who have lost thier minds, usually making thier way here from other places in the realm, attracted to it by the [Exanimate Stone] of [Lothric].

currently ruled by [Lorian], a beefy dark knight, and [Lothric], an emaciated necromancer 


Traveling through Nicosia, explorers will encounter endless zombies


[Lothric]'s collection:

In the catacombs in a peak north of [Nicosia], [Velsharoon] is struggling to bring zombie hoards under his control, and finally starts gaining traction when souls begin pouring into the area from [Vecna]'s [Rotting Tower]. Strong minded enough to overcome the [Exanimate Stone], but feeble to [Velsharoon]'s power in his immediate area. [Velsharoon] would see anyone dead who tries to get in the way of him ruling over [Nicosia] and claiming dominance as the strongest lich of the [Shadowfell]
