++ Nicosia

the [Shadowfell] reflection of [Mayara] in [Fiore]

formerly ruled by the lich [Velsharoon], this city has become a undead slum for undead who have lost thier minds, usually making thier way here from other places in the realm, attracted to it by the [Exanimate Stone] of [Lothric].

currently ruled by [Lorian], a beefy dark knight, and [Lothric], an emaciated necromancer 


Traveling through Nicosia, explorers will encounter endless zombies
