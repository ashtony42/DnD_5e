++ Soneillon

The Youthful Crone lives in a lake at the center of the infinite layer of the 71st layer of the [Abyss], [Spirac]


Soneillon's Immortality:
    when an acceptable offering is presented, the beautiful Soneillon will emerge from the lake, and begin feasting upon the offering, causing a bloody mess. Once she's had her fill, she will gesture for the hunter to follow her back into the lake. If the hunter follows into the depths, they will drown, and their lifeless body will float to the surface a few minutes later, face up. After an hour, they will regain conciousness, but feel no different. Thier skin takes on a blueish hue. And in fact, whenever they die, they will float to the surface of this lake in the same manner as they did the first time.
    
    Only one character can be made immortal by Soneillon's power at a time. And that privilege is always rewarded to the hunter who has brought the best offering. The current best offering has been a Tyrannosaurus Rex (CR 8)
