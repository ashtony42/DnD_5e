AREA EFFECT
++++Rot 
For every one hour that time elapses:
-If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with rot.
-If cursed, the target can't regain hit points
-If cursed, its HP maximum decreases by (3d6) for every 1 hour that elapses.

For every 4 hours while under the curse:
-add 1 point of Exhaustion (pg 291 of players handbook)

If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. 
The curse lasts until the target is out of the Rotting Tower's area of effect. (shown on the map) 

++++The Central Tower 
  50ft x 50ft x 1200ft - each floor is 50ft tall
This 1200ft tower as seen from afar appears to be in ruin, like it could topple at any moment. A swirling vortex of apiritions surround it revealing thier tormented faces and withered shadows of thier former bodies dragging behind them as they float endlessly. Upon a closer look, the tower appears to be architecturally impossible, and at some points, even levitating. 
  Traveling through the vortex of souls will grant 1 point of fatigue(pg 291 player handbook) and 3d6 maximum HP decrease for each pass or round.

  Menagerie of Souls -
    This curious room is quiet, and items are laid about this room delicately. Each unique with it's own glimmer. Physically detacted from the floors above and below through a large crack that traces around the perimeter, it is also uncomfortably still.
    Curated by 15 Wraith (pg 302)
    Prized souls are stored here, when one is taken by a living being, all others retract into a pocket dimension, from which a respective Wraith emerges.

    the door above appears to be locked, and where would normally be a keyhole, is a grove that could fit a ring. Each ring can open the door.
    
  Guarded Layer -
    No one is allowed past this point, 5 Wraiths (pg 302) see sure of that. This room has seen a bit of battle, and the floor often gives way, DEX save DC 10 when moving around to avoid holes in the floor and from creating new holes.   
    
  The Refuse Layer -
    Sometimes brave individuals make thier way to the Rotting Tower for justice or righteousness, thier dust covers the floor of the first room of the tower. A central spiral staircase with a closed wooden hatch leads to the floor above
