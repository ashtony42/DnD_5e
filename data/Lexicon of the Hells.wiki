++ Lexicon of the Hells

A book used by new recruits to the cult of [Ashmadai] to learn the language of Infernal and Abyssal

(can spend 21 days reading to gain proficiency in Infernal)

(can spend another 21 days reading to gain proficiency in Abyssal)

Includes a ritual to open a portal to the first layer of the hells

A waykeeper must attune to a stone entryway,
then paint the entirety of the stones with their own blood to activate. 
(Unfortunately for the members of [Ashmadai] this only works on the existing portal in [Dun Morhen]'s [Wyverns Lair])
