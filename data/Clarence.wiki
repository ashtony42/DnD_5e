Clarence is a child student of the wizard school of corellon in [Nowa Huta]

his loving parents, James and Lily, have been sending him to school to help him "work out his stress" while making use of his natural talents.

Clarence is highly skeptical of the way things are in [Nowa Huta]
The school teaches a large variety of spells, but leaves out various ones that he KNOWS exist due to his sorcery talents.
Clarence tries his best to lie that he's just a wizard like the others, hiding the other abilities he knows

With good Persuasion (18+) he will trust a person who asks about him, and even then, he won't speak his secrets if there are trees around.

On days where he can get away with it, he will escape his studies at school to go to his hideout and work on his conspiracy theories.



++++Clarence's hideout: 
  To the north of the town of [Nowa Huta] (only about 15 minutes out) is an abandonded ground hog tunnel that has dense vines that have been placed over the entrance.
  The tunnel has a Tiny opening, that Clarence can crawl through since he is Small.
  Nature or Perception DC 18 to spot the hidden entrance
  
  Inside the main room of the burrow is a 20ft x 20ft room that has notes posted all around as well as a collection of strange items
  -Note 1: THE TREES CAN HEAR AND SEE, DON'T DO OR SAY ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS AROUND THEM
           -"If someone chases me out here again, just go with them, don't fight it, uhg!"
           -"invisibility seems to work"
  -Note 2: A collection of drawings (3) of [Queen Kallista Damaia] with different shaped horns
           -"Disquise self? but why?"

           -"Why would [Corellon] send us a glass man?"
           -"And now a glass bird man?"
  -Note 4: "Uhg, I hate Kibalf so much, why won't he just let me go when I want to..."   
  -Note 5: "Where aren't there books on the things that I can do?"

             -"What are all the blanks in this book for? Is it water damage or were parts erased?"
