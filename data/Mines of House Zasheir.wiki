++ Mines of House Zasheir

This map shows all of the currently excavated areas near the ash mount of [Kunark] where Skaa are enslaved to mine for rare metals.

Various ends of the map are marked with barricades where presumably something unwanted was found.

Future areas for digging are also planned out on this map.




Blocked off areas:
-Ancient deep burial sites of races long vanquished
    (Sarnak - "dragonkin") kind of like hunched over Iksar with longer feet
    (Trolls) tall like a goliath with bone structures of an orc
    (Ogres) incredibly thick bones, twice the height of a human
    Thousands of skeletons in this mass grave
