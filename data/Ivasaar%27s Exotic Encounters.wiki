++ Ivasaar's Exotic Encounters

This book appears to be a catalog of beasts encountered long ago by an elven ranger named Ivasaar, she has imagry and descriptions of the beasts she's hunted. 

The descriptions and images are detailed enough that a druid can have these as beasts they've seen.

The caveat being that it appears a child has owned this book too, and has colored in the pictures, so the transformations will have the respective bright colorings.

Beasts include:
  - Plesiosaurus
  - Axe Beak
  - Giant Centipede
  - Fire Beetle
  - Giant Sea Horse
  - Giant Weasel
  - Rhinoceros
