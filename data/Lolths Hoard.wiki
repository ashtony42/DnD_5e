++++ Tar River Globe
This transparent glass sphere encloses a miniature scene of a river of tar running through a wasteland. It also contains a mystical golden liquid, which seems like it would mix with the tar if the globe were shaken. You notice ancient, indecipherable writing around the outer base.
    - consumption of the tar inflicts 3d6 poison + 3d6 necrotic damage to the consumer
        + toward Evil
    - consumption of the golden liquid inflicts 3d6 lightning + 3d6 radiant damage to the consumer
        + toward Good
    - consuming the both combined 
        + toward Neutral
(from the Githyanki tribe between the [Shadowfell] and [The Mortal World])        
        
++++ 3 pairs of 6-fingered gloves
    These six-fingered gloves are perfectly white. 
    They do not adhere to the sticky silk of the [Demonweb], and most other sticky surfaces
    
++++ Dimeritium birdcage
    Able to contain a creature that can fit into a 1 by 1 foot cylinder.
      -When a living animal is placed inside this birdcage, the device automatically activates, putting the creature into stasis. Theoretically it could preserve a living being indefinitely, though the cage's size limits this to very small creatures. This cage is inactive.    
      -this is an object saught after by the god of death to be destroyed, but is locked away in this realm.
      
++++ Survivor's Goggles
    The wearer of these goggles sees images of the last 5 minutes of someone/something ([Hadar]) that feels to have existed in the [Demonweb] for a tremendous amount of time, reacting to the images changes what the figure does in the images, always leading to inevitable death by [Lolth]
    -"Its been days, years, weeks, seconds, since I've been trapped in here"
    -"No demon should sustain me like this, what am I?"
