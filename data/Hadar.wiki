++ Hadar

Hadar manifests by being summoned into other realms by warlocks.

Hadar appears as a mass of black tenticles that reach out from a central hovering point in the air.

[Hadar] is forever trapped in the [Demonweb], always searching for an exit, a way to leave, and takes advantage of every portal presented to him by his followers.

Hadar is born of darkness, so after every time he is killed in the [Demonweb] he is born anew in it's dark confines.

Hadar survives by consuming the mist of [Lolth]'s followers.
