++ Rhogar
An assassin of [House Salazar Assassins], a son of Lord Salazar


EVIL GROUP NOTES
    Rhogar, now with his siblings killed at [Kalas] and [Luthadel], is now the rightful heir to [House Salazar]
    
    Amid the chaos in [Luthadel], he traveled to [Gorda] to let things cool down.
    With the rise of [Edan](King Tri-Helm), Rhogar knows him to be a threat that needs to be dealt with.
    
    He's reluctantly joined up with a group of cultists of [Asmodeus] that have historically never succeeded in 
    having contact, but have asserted thier power through the shadows of [Gorda], ocassionally selling rare acquired items.
