88th layer of the [Abyss]

Demon Lord: [Demogorgon], the Prince of Demons

This layer consisted of a vast continent covered in jungle surrounded by an endless ocean and brine flats. 

The jungle portion of the realm, known as the Screaming Jungle, was inhabited by troglodytes, lizardfolk, hezrou, yuan-ti, dinosaurs, dire apes and barlguras. It held a two-way portal connecting to the [Guttering Grove]. Together with Slugbed and Shedaklah, this was one of the layers whose jungles were inhabited by threeb, a type of leech that was the main ingredient of the Quelaerel sauce.

The ocean portion was inhabited by aboleths, ixitxachitl and krakens.
