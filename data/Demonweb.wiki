++ Demonweb

the home realm of [Lolth]

++++Portals
the demon web portals are thick, webbed, and sticky. The more a person or creature struggles in the snare, the more caught up they become, eventually working thier way into the Demonweb. These portals do not grant passage out of the demonweb, the creature in a sense becomes "trapped"

Lolth's demon children have been trapped here for centuries since ancient times when [Venril Sathir] enslaved the [Koloss] to hunt down and burn every last portal to the Demonweb.
-Lolth's demon children are very... hungry

[Regdars Radiant Hilt] is ensared in the demonweb, summoning it will send tremors along the web of this realm, guiding [Edan].
  -[Hadar] may be found consuming energies from the sword

++++Realm Mechanics
  -the entire realm is dimly lit, such that individuals can see about 30ft around them
  -the walls, the ceiling, the floors are all web, difficult terrain, taking 1 extra foot of movement on foot.
  -exiting is a matter of being "summoned" out, commonly by either a follower of [Hadar] or a follow of [Lolth]
    -EVIL GROUP WEENIE when exiting via a dark [Hadar] portal, they will appear by [Tessa]/[Quinn] who are fighting in the brawler's ring in [Gorda]
    -OTHER WEENIE summoned to [Luthadel] by the rogue wizard [Matkina] who is making a getaway from a thieving hiest of [House Stayanoga]
    -FOLLOWER OF [Lolth] WEENIE the character has a portal open beneath them and are sucked through, companions may follow
  -attempting to teleport out of this realm will instead cause the caster to teleport to an existing [Hadar] or [Lolth] portal (if any exist)
