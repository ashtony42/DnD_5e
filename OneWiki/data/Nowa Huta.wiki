++ Nowa Huta

In the center of the island, is the tree ,[Corellon], a massive ancient tree that is easily over 2000ft tall. Larger than any redwood, with branches that span in at least a 500ft radius. Under it's canopy is a wonderful city with possibly the nicest and happiest people to ever exist. With structures so old the original constructors have been forgotten.
Lead by [Queen Kallista Damaia] (Tiefling F)
Surrounded by farm lands, that then again are surrounded by a lush forest. 

Those to pass through the field that surrounds the island will have their memories wiped to some degree. (about 300ft out from the shore)
