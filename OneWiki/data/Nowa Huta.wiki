++ Nowa Huta

In the center of the island, is the tree ,[Corellon], a massive ancient tree that is easily over 2000ft tall. Larger than any redwood, with branches that span in at least a 500ft radius. Under it's canopy is a wonderful city with possibly the nicest and happiest people to ever exist. With some structures so old the original constructors have been forgotten.
Lead by [Queen Kallista Damaia] (Tiefling F)
Surrounded by farm lands, that then again are surrounded by a lush forest. 

Those to pass through the field that surrounds the island will have their memories wiped to some degree. (about 300ft out from the shore)
Maps also become flushed blank parchment.
If the tree of [Corellon] is killed, all people who have ever had or lost memories due to it will regain them.
