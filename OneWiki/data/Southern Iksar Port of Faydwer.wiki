At the port, 4 [Order of Steel] warships are docked

    When a trade vessel leaves or comes back to [Luthadel] from outside the dark waters, it stops here first, any would-be stowe aways will find themselves with only the harsh environment of [Faydwer] to flee to. Anything hazardous would be dealt with away from the main city. Only the most skilled smugglers get past here.
