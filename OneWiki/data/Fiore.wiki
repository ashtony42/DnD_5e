++ Fiore

An archipalego of several islands. Most are sparsely populated whereas the majority of the people who live his are in the central town of Mayara (Elvish for Many).

+++Outer islands:
Lush green vegetation covers the large hill of an island. The sounds of all kinds of birds can be heard, and many are seen flying around. Every other one seems to have a small fishing post established with usually a single home. Three islands have burnt down ruins from where raids from [Redbeard The Unlucky] had occurred.

    Ruined villages can be looted. Each have at least 1 rowboat. 
    Can roll perception:
      diff 20 - find a random d100 trinket (pg 160 of players handbook)
      diff 15 - 1d20 copper
      
    Fishing villages have about 3 commoners who catch fish, and will sell them at a discounted price if you buy them directly from the post (1cp per fish!)
      the commoners tend to have 1d20 copper on them.
       
    Each outer island, if explored has a chance to stumble upon a hidden acient elven ruin can happen. (diff 20, diff 15 if [Legend of Regdar] has been read)
      -history check of 15 can identify the ruins as elven made
      -druid will instantly see glowing druidic text of "Leave, do not cleave that which has been cleaved"
      -there is a stone with a counter clockwise jagged spiral pattern on it, behind it of which is a mummified piece of Tharizdun
        if 6 pieces are collected (head,torso,arm,arm,leg,leg) Tharizdun will be reborn
         
    One of the outer islands has a griffon roost (pg 174 of monster manual) home to one griffon.     
       
+++Central island:
A larger island with a respectively large hill in the center atop which the town of Mayara is established. From a distance, the walls can be seen even from the shore. There are four docking villages on the major North/South/East/West sides of the island.
