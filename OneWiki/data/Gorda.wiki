++ Gorda

This island/city is a bustling town of anarchy and pirates. There's no governance other than your own might and wealth.
Be careful not to wander around alone at night.

The wildlife of Gorda is that of plains/hills. Wild goats and boars roam the island, anything bigger has already been poached to extiction long ago.
