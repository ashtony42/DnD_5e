The crew had supplied food to tide over the refugee camp for a few days before they persuaded the [Marines] to let them join along when they departed.

[Edan] started a fight that resulted in the death of the [Golden Hand] mercenary band that helped the refugee camp, as well as losing [Renegade Leader Kelsier] in the process.
