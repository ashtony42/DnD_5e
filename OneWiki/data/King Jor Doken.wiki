King Jor Doken has many matters that concern him. A lot of Mayara's prosperity comes from trade with [Augsburg], [Ak'anon], [Elbaf], [Alexandria], [Arabasta]
As such, the recent raids of [Don Kreig] and [Rex The Smasher] have been a constant pressure. Thus why he's contributed heavily toward their bounties with the [Marines]

He's also all too aware of the threat of [Luthadel]. They treat any non-iksar worse than slaves, but yet no one has been able to contend with the power of their God King[Venril Sathir]. Luckily, they rarely ever travel from their homeland of [Kunark].
