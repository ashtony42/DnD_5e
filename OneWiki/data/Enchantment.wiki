++ Enchantment

Wizard based enchantment requires prior knowledge to perform and will have permenant effects

Scorcerer based enchantment requires no prior knowledge to perform and will have temporary effects

enchantment effects must be based off of themes from spells the caster is able to cast.
enchantments based off of spells that require a material item to cast will require the target item to contain that component.
