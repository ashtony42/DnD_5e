(Player Readable)

A long time ago, the god Kord lived on [Arabasta] back when it was bountiful in diversity and life. He spent his days fighting giant creatures and beasts, swearing to his brothers and sisters that creatures had the will within them to ascend from their mortality. Centuries past by as Kord continued to defeat every creature and beast that challenged him. In a fit of frustration, he changed his land, Arabasta, to be most inhospitable. Scorching rays, dry sands, sharp winds without rain. In a bout of most unexpected boredom, he then volunarily sealed himself within a stone, sleeping within until someone or something strong enough as to break it would become an actual, true, challenge.
