Tiefling scorcerer who joined the evil group via the inn at Mayara

consumed the Dragon [AkumaFruits]

his soul is held by the [Crones of Neriak]

Kreiger soul memories:    
    Memories fill your mind of a foggy, dreary place in a dead-wooded area of Faydwer. 
    Your parents, struggling for life as they were, hastily fleeing from a firey glow in the distance.  
    Rowing out to sea. 
    For days.
    Rowing.
    Through the fog.
    It felt like forever.
    Landing eventually at somewhere unknown.
    Lead into a cave where your parents pleaded with some hideous elders.
    Pleading for help.
    Pleading for strength.
    Pleading for magic.
    ...
    You then woke up in Luthadel some time later, alone.
