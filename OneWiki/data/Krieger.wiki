Kreiger soul memories:    
    Memories fill your mind of a foggy, dreary place in a dead-wooded area of Faydwer. 
    Your parents, struggling for life, hastily fleeing from a firey glow in the distance.  
    Rowing out to sea. 
    For days.
    Rowing.
    Through the fog.
    It felt like forever.
    Landing eventually at somewhere unknown.
    Lead into a cave where your parents pleaded with some hideous elders.
    Pleading for help.
    Pleading for strength.
    Pleading for magic.
    ...
    You then woke up in Luthadel some time later, alone.
    Beloved parents nowhere to be found.
