++ Kaladim

An ancient dwarven city built into a mountain. A large statue of a dwarf (50ft tall) standing proud with his respectively large battle axe overgrown with vines stands vigil at the top of the entrance. 

Clearing the vines reveals the entrance below the statue.

The inside is littered with broken human arms, the remainder of each respective body is nowhere to be found. Many bricks and other masonry lie about the caves as if they were once part of some previously existing structure.
