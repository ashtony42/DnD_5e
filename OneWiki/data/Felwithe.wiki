Old ruined city of high elves in [Faydwer] destroyed long ago by ancient Iksar armies during the rise to power of [Venril Sathir]

A humanoid [Mistwraith] named [Oliander] stands vigil in front of a statue of a woman whose skin is covered in thousands of scars. Hair that flows like fire over her shoulders, wearing armor adorned by skulls, and a single skull on her right hip.

A plaque with Draconic writing sloppily etched upon it sits at the base of the statue:
"Kadi, may you never have progeny, and may you never return to cull this world."

++++Palace of Tearis Thex
A concecrated building, that does not see the wear and tear of the rest of the ruins, though in a demolished state. An ancient order of paladins once called this thier temple, and a paladin king, [Tearis Thex] home. Looting the kings corpse will yield:

-Platemail of Tearis Thex, a holy armor that offers the wearer resistance to necrotic damage

++++Ruined Wizard's Guild
several class rooms with rotted wood desks, but their tarnished brass metal adornments protrude like bones in a carcas.

A teacher's desk has a level 4 and 5 wizard scroll in it, still legible, roll randomly to select what is found
