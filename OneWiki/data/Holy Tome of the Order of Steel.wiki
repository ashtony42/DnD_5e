Grants knowledge of the heirarchical structure of the Order of Steel and [Luthadel] itself from Skaa to the God King himself.

Might, Strength, Persistence, Strict. Laws must be enforced, and peace will be wrought. The God King [Venril Sathir] shall guide us to the end of days. He has brought order and a means of existence that brings us closer to Elysium while still on this wretched planet. Those deemed worthy of his grace are granted the right, and can then join his side at his palace.
