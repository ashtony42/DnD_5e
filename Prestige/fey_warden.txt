# Fey Warden
Fey wardens learn the secrets of ancient faerie magic, guarded zealously by powerful fey. It is said that the first fey wardens were elves, but members of many other races can learn the secrets.
The fey rarely share the secrets of the fey warden. When they do, they demand that supplicants perform difficult tasks in their name, though once an individual proves themselves worthy, the fey accept the newly minted fey warden into their ranks, supporting them as long as the warden supports the fey.
