# Behemoth
A Behemoth, a person of great strength and fortitude who has proven themself by training with the mightiest of giants. Few ever persue this training, and even fewer are able to survive it. The rigorous sparring an individual undergoes with their giant trainer will often result with broken bones and scars.

However, bones heal back stronger, muscles will grow larger, and what training doesn't kill a Behemoth only makes them greater. A Behemoth's training is known to be complete when they are able to take on the Form of the Behemoth, earning themselves a place in the afterworld amungst the greatest giants ever known and making themself a legend.
